#  The logic od runnign this script is as folows: 
# 1. check the current location of itself and store it in CURRENT_DIR
# 2. FOR each .desktop fille present in the curent directory
#    a. Replace the following placeholders in the .desktop file with actual paths:
#       - %CURRENT_DIR%: The directory where this script is located
#       - %PARENT_DIR%: The parent directory of where this script is located
#       - %HOME%: The user's home directory
#    b. Copy the modified .desktop file to the user's local applications directory (~/.local/share/applications/)
#       - If same name file exist Print the existing file, ask user whether to overwrite or skip (y/N) -> default is skip
# 3. End of script
